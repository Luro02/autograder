# API

suggest-replacement = Use '{$suggestion}' instead of '{$original}'.
common-reimplementation = The code can be simplified to '{$suggestion}'.

use-string-formatted = '{$formatted}' is easier to read.
use-format-string = '{$formatted}' is easier to read.

optional-tri-state = Instead of an Optional boolean, one should use an enum.

equals-hashcode-comparable-contract = Equals and hashCode must always be overridden together. Similarly for Comparable, both equals and hashCode must be overwritten.

use-enum-collection = For maps where an enum is used as a key and for sets as a value, one should use EnumMap/EnumSet.

compare-to-zero = The result of #compareTo or #compare should only be compared to 0.
                It is an implementation detail whether a given type returns the values
                '-1, 0, +1' or others.
equals-using-hashcode = Implementing equals by just comparing hashCodes is fragile.
                Hashes collide frequently, and this will lead to false positives in equals.
equals-unsafe-cast = The contract of equals states that it should return false for incompatible
                    types, while this implementation may throw ClassCastException.
equals-incompatible-type = An equality test between objects with incompatible types always returns false
inconsistent-hashcode = Including fields in hashCode which are not compared in equals violates the contract of hashCode.
undefined-equals = This type is not guaranteed to implement a useful equals method.
non-overriding-equals = equals method doesn't override Object.equals
equals-broken-for-null = equals implementation may throw NullPointerException when given null
array-hash-code = hashCode method on array does not hash array contents
equals-reference = == must be used in equals method to check equality to itself or an infinite loop will occur.
array-as-key-of-set-or-map = Arrays do not override equals or hashCode, so comparisons will be done on reference
                            equality only. If neither deduplication nor lookup are needed, consider using a List
                            instead.

implement-comparable = The type '{$name}' should implement `Comparable<{$name}>`, then the `Comparator` becomes redundant.

comment-language-exp-invalid = The language of this comment is neither English nor German but seems to be {$lang}
comment-language-exp-english = The code contains comments in German and in English. This comment is in English. A German comment can be found at {$path}:{$line}
comment-language-exp-german = The code contains comments in German and in English. This comment is in German. An English comment can be found at {$path}:{$line}

complex-regex = Nontrivial regex need an explanation (score is {$score}, max allowed score is {$max})

redundant-catch = An exception should not be caught and then rethrown immediately.

redundant-uninitialized-variable = The variable '{$variable}' has been declared, but the value '{$value}' is not directly assigned. Instead write '{$suggestion}'.

                  Writing it thread-safe makes the code unnecessarily complex.

try-catch-complexity = The complexity of try-catch-blocks should be kept low.
                       There should be less than {$max} statements in the try-block.
                       Refactor the code into multiple methods or extract unnecessary
                       statements out of the try-block.

redundant-else = The 'else' is redundant. Write '{$expected}' instead of '{$given}'.

redundant-assignment = The variable '{$variable}' is assigned a value that is never read,
                       therefore the assignment can be removed.

suppress-warnings = '@SuppressWarnings' suppresses warnings from the compiler or Checkstyle, without fixing the underlying problem of the code.

scanner-closed = Scanner should be closed

unchecked-type-cast = It has to be ensured that the type of the object is the same as that of the cast. Otherwise, the code might crash.

compare-char-value = Here '{$expression}' of type 'char' is compared with the value {$intValue}. It is not obvious which letter the value represents, therefore write '{$charValue}'.

import-types = Instead of qualifying the type, '{$type}' should be imported. Types from the same package or 'java.lang' do not have to be imported explicitly.

use-different-visibility = The visibility of '{$name}' should be '{$suggestion}'.
use-different-visibility-field = The visibility of field '{$name}' should always be '{$suggestion}'.

avoid-recompiling-regex = The constant is only used with 'Pattern.compile' or 'Pattern.matches'. Convert the constant to a pattern with the value '{$suggestion}'.

binary-operator-on-boolean = Instead of '|' and '&' one should use '||' and '&&'.

object-datatype = Instead of the datatype 'Object', the variable '{$variable}' should have a concrete or generic datatype.

magic-literal = {$value} is a magic {$type}.

loop-should-be-do-while = This loop should be a do-while loop, because the code before the loop is the same as the code in the loop: {$suggestion}

loop-should-be-for = This loop should be a for-loop: {$suggestion}
loop-should-be-while = This loop should be a while-loop: {$suggestion}

# Naming

constants-name-exp = The name '{$name}' is non-descriptive for the value {$value}
constants-name-exp-value = The value {$value} of the constant '{$name}' should not be in the name

linguistic-naming-boolean = The name of '{$name}' indicates that it is/returns a boolean instead of '{$type}'.
linguistic-naming-getter = The name of '{$name}' indicates that it returns a value, which is not the case.
linguistic-naming-setter = The name of '{$name}' indicates that it is a setter, which should not return a value.

variable-name-single-letter = Single letter names such as '{$name}' are usually non-descriptive

variable-name-type-in-name = The identifier '{$name}' should not contain its type in the name.
similar-identifier = The identifier '{$left}' is very similar to '{$right}'. This can lead to confusion and typos, which is why it should be renamed.

type-has-descriptive-name-exception = A class that inherits from Exception should have 'Exception' at the end of its name

package-naming-convention = The name of a package should be a single word and all letters should be lowercase by convention.
                            Except for the character '_', no special characters should appear. The following positions do not

variable-redundant-number-suffix = The identifier '{$name}' has a redundant number at the end.

# OOP
concrete-collection = The type '{$type}' should be replaced by an interface like 'List' or 'Set'.

leaked-collection-return = The method '{$method}' returns a reference to the field '{$field}'.
                           This allows the field to be modified from the outside.
                           Instead, a copy should be returned.
leaked-collection-constructor = The constructor '{$signature}' assigns a reference to the field '{$field}'.
                                This allows the field to be modified from the outside. Instead,
                                a copy should be made before setting the field.
leaked-collection-assign = The method '{$method}' assigns a reference to the field '{$field}'.
                           This enables modification of the field from the outside. Instead,
                           a copy should be made before setting the field.

method-should-be-abstract = '{$type}::{$method}' should be abstract and not provide a default implementation

method-should-be-static = The method '{$name}' should be static, because it does not access instance attributes or methods.

utility-exp-final = Utility class is not final
utility-exp-constructor = Utility classes must have a single private no-arg constructor

static-field-should-be-instance = The static field '{$name}' must not be static.

constants-class-exp = Constants should be saved in the class they are used in and not in a dedicated class.

empty-interface-exp = Interfaces should not be empty.

ui-output-separation = Output should not be spread over the program. Other use in {$first}.

do-not-use-system-exit = 'System.exit()' must not be used. Structure code so that it exits naturally.

avoid-inner-classes = Every class should be in its own file. Inner-Classes should be avoided.

mutable-enum = Enums should be immutable.

should-be-enum-attribute = The values of the switch should be associated attributes of the enum. Alternatively, one should use a Map.

closed-set-of-values-switch = The switch has only finitely many cases. This is a closed set, which should be modeled as an enum. The values are: '{$values}'.
closed-set-of-values-list = The listing only has finitely many values and should therefore be modeled as an enum. The values are: '{$values}'.
closed-set-of-values-method = The method only returns the constant values '{$values}'. There are only finitely many, which is why one should model it as an enum.

do-not-use-instanceof = 'instanceof' should not be used.
do-not-use-instanceof-emulation = 'instanceof' should not be used and not be emulated through
                                  'getClass' or 'ClassCastException'.

abstract-class-without-abstract-method = Abstract classes should have at least one abstract method.
composition-over-inheritance = The parent class has only fields. Instead of inheritance, composition
                               should be used. For example through an interface with the getter:
                               '{$suggestion}'.
should-be-interface = The parent class has only methods without fields. Instead of inheritance an
                      interface with default-implementations should be used.

avoid-static-blocks = Static blocks should be avoided because they are not expandable and
                      object-oriented. Static blocks should be replaced by an object-oriented
                      solution (e.g. constructor).

# Structure

default-package = The default-package should not be used. The following classes are in the
                  default-package: {$positions}
too-few-packages = The project has more than {$max} classes, but only one package is used.
                   Use multiple packages to structure the code.

# Unnecessary
empty-block = Empty blocks should be removed or have a comment explaining why they are empty.

unused-element = '{$name}' is unused and should therefore be removed
